		<h1> Tips</h1>
		<h4></h4>
		<h4> Taxis in the Galapagos Islands are white trucks, and local taxis rides are $2.</h4>
		<h4> You can get a GOOD, authentic meal for $5. (See food guide for more info)</h4>
		<h4> Isabela island apparently does not have any ATM's on the island, so take out cash beforehand if you go.</h4>
		<h4> Do not bring $100 bills to Galapagos; banks do not give them out and they are very hard to break. They can be used to pay the $100 park entrance fee, but make sure to bring new and fresh looking bills because they are skeptical of fake money.</h4>
		<h4> Do not carry around large amounts of cash with you. If your backpack or bag gets broken into while you are snorkeling/swimming, your phone wallet and keys will likely be fine, but the cash will be gone. I never had trouble with this until my second to last day, but better to be safe than sorry. </h4>
		<h4> I highly recommend flying into San Cristobal airport rather than Santa Cruz. The airport in San Cristobal is walking distance from the center of town (or a $2 taxi ride), whereas Santa Cruz (Baltra) is a $10 shuttle, a $2 boat taxi, and a $40 cab. After leaving the airport, it will take you about 5 minutes to ride into town from San Cristobal, but it will take you about 2 hours from Baltra/Santa Cruz. San Cristobal is cheaper and easier!</h4>
		<h4> You can stay in a very nice hostel for $20-$30 a night per person. Also, most 'hostels' have private rooms, so don't assume they are all communal. Don't feel the need to overpay like you would in the United States. If you're paying more than $100 a night for a private room, you won't be getting an authentic Galapagos experience, and you aren't supporting local businesses. Check yelp reviews if you are unsure, but you will be pleasantly surprised at the affordability of nice accomodations.</h4>
