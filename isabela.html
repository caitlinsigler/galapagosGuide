    <h2> Things to do for free: </h2>
    <h3>Concha Perla</h3>
    <h4>Concha Perla is one of a few snorkelling spots on Isabela Island, and it is arguably the best one in which you can swim for free. It is a sheltered lagoon and you will have the opportunity to see a variety of animals. To get here, you can orient yourself at the Isabela pier, then continue east along a skinny boardwalk that will take you to the lagoon. </h4>
		<h4> At Concha Perla, you can see sea lions, sea turtles, spotted eagle rays, and marbled rays. You can also see marine iguanas on the rocks, and there is a chance to see iguanas swimming and even reef sharks hiding on the sandy bottom. You can also see a variety of sea urchins and sea stars.
</h4>
    <h3>Posa Salinas</h3>
    <h4>Posa Salinas is a wooden boardwalk where you can walk and see a variety of birds, including the American flamingo, on your way to the Isabela tortoise breeding center. To get here, you follow the road parallel to the ocean going west, and you will see the marked pathway on your right. If you get to a fork in the road, you have just passed it.
</h4>
    <h4>The walkway follows the coastal salt marshes and you will have the opportunity to see flamingos, ducks, and other waterfowl such as black necked stilts and great blue herons. You can also see marine iguanas swimming or scaling the walls of nearby buildings. </h4>
    <h3>Casa Rosada</h3>
    <h4>Casa Rosada is a beachfront house and a bar owned by a friend of mine who allows allows marine iguanas to breed in her backyard. To get there, you follow the main road parallel to the ocean going west. You can follow the road or follow along on the main beach going west. It is the only pink house and it is at the very western end of the beach. You can see hundreds of juvenile marine iguanas hanging out in her small yard and climbing on her house walls! Her house is also very close to the beginning of the path known as Posa Salinas where you can walk among flamingos on your way to the tortoise breeding center.
</h4>
    <h3>Tortoise Breeding Center</h3>
    <h4>The Isabela Island breeding center is the second most accessible breeding center in the Islands (the easiest breeding center to get to is in Santa Cruz). Entrance to the breeding center is free, you just need to take a short walk there, or you can take a $2 taxi. As part of the walk there, you can follow the scenic boardwalk path known as Posa Salinas. To get there, you can use google maps and type in “Centro de Crianza Tortugas Gigantes” and it will show you how to walk there. On your way, you will pass the marked trail for Posa Salinas and you can choose to take the path instead of walking in the street. While at the breeding center, you will see a variety of sizes of tortoises in large pens. You will be able to read information about the turtles and see how old some of them are. Fun fact: the age of the largest tortoises are largely unknown because they are older than the center itself!
</h4>
    <h3>Playa del Amor, Túnel de Estero, Cerro Orchilla, Los Humedales, and El Muro de las Lágrimas (Wall of Tears)</h3>
    <h4>These sites are all along the same path along the westers side of the city in Isabela. They are listed in order by distance from town from closest to furthest. You can walk to these locations or rent a bike for $2 an hour. The total distance covered if you do all three activities is about 18km. Along this path, you can see Galápagos tortoises wandering around freely, and you will pass various side paths with secluded beaches, natural pools, and lava tunnels. Make sure to bring sun protection and lots of water! To get to the trailhead, use Google Maps towards Cerro Orchilla. </h4>
    <h4>Playa del Amor is a secluded small beach along the path where you can see many marine iguanas and take a break from your walk to enjoy some scenery. </h4>
    <h4>Túnel de Estero is a naturally formed lava tunnel. It’s worth stopping to check it out while walking along the path!</h4>
    <h4>After about 4 km, you will walk through los Humedales, which is mangrove forest home to all four mangrove species in the Galápagos. Mangroves are a super unique plant species and very pretty to walk through. Spend some time taking the small side paths to find small secluded beaches. </h4>
    <h4>After about 6 km, you will pass Cerro Orchilla, which is a stunning lookout point on the western side of the town in Isabela. At the top, you can see views of the long stretching beach, the volcanoes, and the stunning coastline of Isabela Island. </h4>
    <h4>If you continue even further from town about another kilometer, you will arrive at El Muro de las Lágrimas (a.k.a. The Wall of Tears). This site received its name because it was built by prisoners, and due to the tall height of the wall, many prisoners died during its construction. The wall itself is made of stone, and has a lot of interesting history. </h4>

    <h2> Cheap Attractions: </h2>
    <h3>Bike Rentals</h3>
    <h4>All of the free activities listed above can be reached by bike. If you would like to get to see more places in a shorter period of time, renting a bike starting at $2 an hour may be a good idea!
</h4>

    <h2> Paid Tours: </h2>
    <h3> Los Túneles ($150-$200)</h3>
    <h4>Los Túneles is a recently opened tourist area on the islands. The location was previously only used as a resting place for fisherman because the water is calm. Túneles is composed of beautiful lava rock formations, which include underwater tunnels that you can swim through. I am not confident of the price you would get for this tour if you booked it in person because I went on this tour with my class. Online it is listed as a $200 tour, but I would guess that you could book it for cheaper in person. </h4>
    <h4>Tuneles is a lot of fun. Not only can you see blue footed boobies close up on the rocks above water, but in the water you can swim through underwater lava tunnels and coves. Swimming through underwater lava tunnels may seem a bit scary to some people, but even without swimming through the tunnels this part of the tour is super fun. You also have the chance of seeing turtles, white tipped reef sharks, and sea lions in the water.</h4>
    <h4>After Túneles, you will be taken to another cove/beach called Cabo Rosa. Here you can find more turtles as well as rays and sharks along the sandy bottom. Lastly, if your guide has good eyes, he will find your group a seahorse or two. Seahorses are small and are really good at camouflaging, so finding them is difficult but rewarding. </h4>
    <h3>Tintoreras ($80)</h3>
    <h4>Tintoreras is a group of small rock clusters just off of the coast of the town in Isabela. You can take a kayaking tour or a boat tour, both of which will include snorkeling. While snorkeling, you might see fish, turtles, sea lions, and marine iguanas. If you are lucky, you will see a few Galápagos Penguins. This is one of the few day tours that you can take to see Galápagos penguins; the other tours (with the exception of Bartolome) are all multi day. </h4>
    <h3>Volcán Sierra Negra ($80)</h3>
    <h4>Volcán Sierra Negra is an active volcano with a giant crater that is accessible by hiking 5 miles (10 miles round trip). The last major eruption was in 2005, so it has beautiful sparkling lava rocks scattered about. It is a beautiful view, and the path is lined with guava trees that you can snack on along the way. Make sure to bring lots of water and sun protection because the shade is minimal.
