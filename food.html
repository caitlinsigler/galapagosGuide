		<h1> Galapagos Food</h1>
		<h4> A good, authentic meal in the Galapagos only costs $5. While western and modern looking restaurants may catch your eye, avoid the urge and go to a small, local restaurant instead.</h4>
		<h4> In order to get the $5 meal, you need to order from the specials menu, or the menu of the day 'menu del dia'. There will be other things listed on the menu but they will be more expensive. </h4>
		<h4> To ask the price of the food, ask "cuanto cuesta el almuerzo?" or "cuanto cuesta la cena?" for dinner. The going rate for a soup, juice, and entree is $5 if you are at the local spots.</h4>
		<h4> In San Cristobal, I ate lunch almost every day at "patio de comidas" or "el faro"(directions on Google Maps).</h4>
		<h4> In Santa Cruz, there is a street closed off to traffic at night that is filled entirely with tables and chairs for restaurants lined up and down the street. You can follow directions on Google Maps to "Kiosko de Renato" or "Sazon Manabita", which are two of the restaurants on that street. Walk along the street looking at the specials, until you see something that looks good. You can't go wrong with the restaurant that you choose. There is also a great $1 soft serve ice cream shop at the end of the street. </h4>
		<h4> If you want to go all out, you can get a two person lobster dinner (it's incredible, I highly recommend) for $20-25 dollars. The same applies to Brujo, a white fish, which is really delicious, and a Galapagos specialty.</h4>
		<h4> Try bolones! They are fried balls of plantain, cheese, and meat, usually coming with a sauce, and a fried egg on top. These were my go to ($5), and they never get old. My favorite place to get them was at "El Faro" on San Cristobal.</h4>
		<h4> Don't be afraid to get food from stands on the side of the road. The classic street foods are empanadas, maduro con queso (sweet plantain with cheese), and choclo (kind of like an elote, it is corn on the cob with mayo and cheese). Even if some of this food sounds a bit unique, TRUST me, these are must-try's.</h4>
		<h4> You must go to panaderias and try pan con chocolate, alfajores, pan de yuca, and orejas. This is not optional. The best panaderia in all of the islands (in me and my host mother's humble opinions) is Panaderia Barcelona in San Cristobal.</h4>
		<h4> To get to Panaderia Barcelona, type in directions to "Cento Internacional de convenciones Charles Darwin" in Google maps. You will walk up a small hill away from the center of town, and the panaderia is the yellow building on the corner across the street. </h4>
